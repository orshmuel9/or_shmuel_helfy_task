# Project Design Decisions & Time Tracking

I started from the server side
I started the base of it, it took me about 75 minutes.
Then I moved to the client side, I started with presenting the tasks in a basic way, then when I saw that it worked I added some designs and moved on to the next tasks, while I adjusted the server, it took me about two and a quarter hours, adjusting the server, the client, and the CSS, then I checked that everything worked in the remaining time. And I fixed all kinds of bugs.
